# a basic vxms-core example

This example shows the minimum usage of vxms-core. It defines a HTTP endpoint on port 9090 and two REST (Get) endpoints. You can start the service using the *main* method or you build the project (*mvn package*) and run the fat jar (*java -jar target/vxms-core-demo-one-fat.jar*).
